# BLADE//runner API Tutorial
This repository hosts a bunch of guided example scripts to serve as a tutorial to **BLADE//runner's** native *JSON/WebSockets* API and it's bundled *javascript/typescript** layer `**vapi**`.

## Requirements 
Obviously you will need a **BLADE//runner** device (such as the *AT300*), visit https://arkonatech.com/ for more information.
Apart from that you will need node.js and npm, visit https://nodejs.org/en/ for more information on how to obtain it.

## Additional Requirements
Some scripts require some more specialized software for displaying or converting graphics, see [*Requirements.md*](requirements.md) for more information.
