# Reqirements

The `make.sh` script will take care of installing the vapi,vscript and vutil packages from your BLADE//runner device to your system. Apart from that you will of course need a modern veriosn of node.js. 
Some Examples create small clips from .svg files. These require inkscape 1.12 or higher. If your Package Manager does not offer a sufficiently up-to-date version, please visit [inkscapes website for instructions](https://inkscape.org/release/1.2.1/)
